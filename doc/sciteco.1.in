.SH DESCRIPTION
.
\*(ST is an interactive
.B TECO
dialect, similar to
.BR "Video TECO" .
It also adds features from classic
.BR "Standard TECO-11" ,
and incorporates many unique new ideas.
It is geared towards UNIX-like operating systems but also
natively supports Microsoft Windows NT\*(Tm.
.
.LP
When executed, \*(ST mungs (executes) the TECO macro stored in the file
specified by the
.B \-\-mung
option.
The munged file is executed in non-interactive
.RI ( batch )
mode, allowing the user to write stand-alone TECO scripts.
In contrast to ordinary macro execution,
if the first two characters of the file are \(lq#!\(rq its first line
is ignored.
Therefore under UNIX-like operating systems, TECO macro files may be
invoked as scripts by using a Hashbang line like
.RS
.EX
#!@bindir@/sciteco -m
.EE
.RE
If the munged macro does not request program termination using the
.I EX
command, \*(ST will automatically switch into its graphical
.I interactive
mode.
\*(ST may be built with different graphical user interfaces,
including Curses and GTK+ based ones.
.
.LP
Upon startup \*(ST's buffer ring contains only one unnamed empty buffer.
All command line arguments after the \*(ST options are passed as
.I arguments
to the munged macro by placing each argument on its own line in
the buffer.
In any case the current buffer position (called
.IR dot )
is left at the beginning of the buffer.
Optionally \(lq\-\-\(rq might be used to separate \*(ST options and
macro arguments.
.
.LP
Batch mode also has the following differences compared to interactive mode:
.RS
.IP \(bu
Messages are logged to
.I stdout
or
.I stderr
prefixed with a string signifying message severity.
.IP \(bu
Any error will terminate the program.
.IP \(bu
Character rubout is disabled.
Therefore code runs significantly faster than in interactive mode
and less care needs to be taken regarding memory clutter due to
undo token accumulation.
.RE
.
.LP
If the
.B \-\-mung
option is absent, \*(ST will mung
.I $SCITECOCONFIG/.teco_ini
(if existing) which is called the profile.
On UNIX/Linux, the default profile is at
.I ~/.teco_ini
(see \fBENVIRONMENT\fP).
The profile will usually set up various Scintilla and \*(ST options,
configure syntax highlighting,
define commonly used macros and open files specified as arguments to \*(ST.
It will usually leave the editor in interactive mode.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.IP "\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR"
Display a short help text on the console. 
.IP "\fB-e\fR, \fB--eval\fR \fImacro"
Evaluate (execute)
.I macro
specified as a command-line option.
Similar to munging but always exits afterwards.
If the option is specified, the
.B \-\-mung
option has no effect.
.IP "\fB-m\fR, \fB--mung\fR \fIfile"
Mung \fIfile\fP.
Default is
.IR $SCITECOCONFIG/.teco_ini .
.
.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.
\*(ST will return a non-null exit code if an error occurred during
batch mode processing.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.
Before \*(ST executes any macro, all of the variables in the process
environment are inserted into the global
.I Q-Register
table.
A dollar sign is prepended before each variable name, so that for
instance the variable \(lqHOME\(rq can be examined by macros by
reading the string-content of Q-Register \(lq$HOME\(rq.
The following environment variables are initialized with default
values by \*(ST if they are unset:
.TP
.B SCITECOCONFIG
Path where \*(ST looks for configuration files.
For instance, this is the path of the default profile.
If unset, this variable defaults to the \fBHOME\fP
environment variable on UNIX/Linux.
If \fBHOME\fP is unset, it defaults to the current user's
home directory as set by
.BR passwd (5).
On Windows, this variable defaults to the location of the
\*(ST program executable, so that \*(ST is self-contained
on Windows.
On other platforms, this variable defaults to some other
user-specific configuration directory.
.TP
.B SCITECOPATH
Standard library macro path.
Macros can expect to find standard library macros in this
directory.
On Windows, this variable defaults to the \(lqlib\(rq
subdirectory of the directory containing
the \*(ST program executable, so that \*(ST is self-contained
on Windows.
On all other platforms (including UNIX/Linux) this variable
defaults to the standard library installation path at
.BR "@scitecolibdir@" .
.
.
.SH FILES
.
.TP
.B $SCITECOCONFIG/.teco_ini
Default profile macro.
.TP
.B @pkgdatadir@/sample.teco_ini
Sample profile macro configuring commonly used run-time options,
syntax highlighting, session handling
and opening files specified on the command line.
.TP
.B $SCITECOPATH/*.tes
Standard library macros.
.TP
.BI .teco- x - filename
Save point files created by \*(ST when saving files
during interactive execution have this format.
These files can be ignored by version control systems, etc.
.TP
.B $SCITECOCONFIG/.teco_session
Macro storing the default buffer session.
This is not written by \*(ST itself, but by the
standard library \fBsession.tes\fP macros.
When the \(lqsession.vcs\(rq macro is used, these files
will also be created in the roots of Git, Mercurial and
Subversion repositories or working copies.
.
.
.SH BUGS
.
\*(ST does not have any such thing called \(lqbug\(rq.
Any conceived misbehaviour must be totally your fault.
